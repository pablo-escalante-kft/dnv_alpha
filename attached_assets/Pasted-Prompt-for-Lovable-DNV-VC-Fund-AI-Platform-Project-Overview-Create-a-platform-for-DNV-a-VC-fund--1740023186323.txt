Prompt for Lovable: DNV VC Fund AI Platform

Project Overview

Create a platform for DNV, a VC fund that leverages AI to analyze startups and assess their potential. The platform should streamline startup evaluation through a structured input system, AI-powered analysis, and an interactive, shareable dashboard.

The design should feature a black theme with dark gradients from charcoal to deep gray for a sleek and modern look.
